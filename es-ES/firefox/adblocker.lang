;An ad blocker is a piece of software that can be used to block ads, and they work in two ways. The first way is when an ad blocker blocks the signal from an advertiser’s server, so the ad never shows up on your page. Another way ad blockers work is by blocking out sections of a website that could be ads.
Un bloqueador de anuncios es una pieza de software que se puede usar para bloquear anuncios, y funcionan de dos maneras. La primera forma es cuando un bloqueador de anuncios bloquea la señal del servidor de un anunciante, por lo que el anuncio nunca aparece en su página. Otra forma en que funcionan los bloqueadores de anuncios es bloqueando secciones de un sitio web que podrían ser anuncios.
