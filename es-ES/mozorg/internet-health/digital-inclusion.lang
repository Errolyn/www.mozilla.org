;A Healthy Internet is Inclusive to All
Un Internet saludable es inclusivo con todos


;The more voices, perspective, languages, and people contributing to the Web, the richer the experience for everyone. But the whole Internet is not yet accessible, welcoming, and safe for all. Together, we have the power to shape the Web, and our world along with it.
Cuantas más voces, perspectivas, idiomas y gente contribuya con la Web, más rica será la experiencia para todo el mundo. Pero no todo Internet es aún accesible, acogedor y seguro para todos. Juntos tenemos el poder de dar forma a la Web, y con ello a nuestro mundo.


;A healthy Internet is open to you.
Un Internet saludable está abierto a ti.


;Here are three areas where we can make a difference.

;For the Internet to fulfill its greatest promise, it must reflect the diversity and experience of all people, everywhere.
Para que Internet cumpla su mayor promesa, debe reflejar la diversidad y experiencia de todas las personas, en todas partes.


;As inclusive as the Web can seem, it’s not yet an equal playing field. More than half the world is still without it; emerging economies and marginalized communities are often the last to gain access. Far fewer women are using the Internet than men. And without diversity among its creators, the Web itself will reflect unconscious biases, while personalizing algorithms can reinforce our own.

;We’ve all seen our share of nasty comments sections. At times, the Web can feel like a very unfriendly place – particularly for women, minorities, and members of marginalized communities. By discouraging people from getting online, cyberbullying and cyber violence threaten not just individuals, but the Internet itself.

;To participate online, you have to be able to get online. Programs have emerged that offer free or subsidized Internet access, but it is often slow or restricted, creating a ‘poor Internet for poor people.’ At its most extreme, governments worldwide are turning off all or parts of the Internet to serve their own agendas, which can threaten human rights and even the health of the global economy.
