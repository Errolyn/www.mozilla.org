;Firefox is now faster and leaner
Firefox сега е по-бърз и компактен


# Working out means exercising to get lighter and more proficent.  Here it means Firefox is lighter thus the speed faster.
;We’ve been working out, so you can get more done.
Ние се потрудихме, за да може вие да свършите повече.


;Use less memory
Използва по-малко памет


# A hog is something that claims or takes all of everything. Here it references to a program that takes up all the resources and slow down the computer.
# Lean and mean here means having no excess of what's needed and is single focused. Mean also is defined as nasty, thus the reference of "we're pretty nice". Be transcreative if needed.
;No one likes a computer hog! Firefox is a lean, mean (actually we’re pretty nice) browsing machine. Since we use less RAM than Chrome, your other programs can keep running at top speed.
Никой не иска бавен компютър! Firefox е лек и бърз четец. Понеже използва по-малко оперативна памет от Chrome останалите програми няма да бъдат забавяни поради недостатъчна памет.
