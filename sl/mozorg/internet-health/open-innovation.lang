Open Innovation means innovating collectively through shared ideas and open source code.


;A healthy Internet is open for innovation
Zdrav internet je odprt za inovacije


;The Internet was built on the promise that any one of us might create the next big thing. But in order to keep creating, imagining, and reinventing our future online, the building blocks of the Web must be open to all. And together, we need to make sure the policies and laws that govern those building blocks are fair and functional.

And together, we need to make sure the policies and laws that govern those building blocks are fair and functional.


;A healthy Internet is created by you.
Zdrav internet ustvarjate vi.


;Here are three areas where we can make a difference.
Tukaj so tri področja, kjer lahko naredimo razliko.


;Support Open Source
Podprimo odprto kodo

;Open Source: Keeping the building blocks of the Web open for creativity
Odprta koda: ohranjanje gradnikov spleta odprtih za spodbujanje kreativnosti


;Open source should continue to be the heart of the Internet, so we can all see, verify, and contribute to its future.

;Open source software – technology built with code that is open for view, use, and modification – is the engine that powers a huge amount of the Internet, from servers to operating systems to the bots that fetch your search results. It’s the infrastructure that makes the Web a truly public resource: transparent, trustworthy, and collaborative, so that anyone with an idea can contribute. But much like our IRL infrastructure, we have to commit the attention and resources to maintain it.

;How you can engage in copyright reform
Kako se lahko zavzamete za reforme avtorskih pravic


;Keep the pressure on
Vzdržujte pritisk


;Protests against SOPA/PIPA in the US and ACTA in Europe led to the shelving of laws that may have hindered open innovation. EU citizens: the <a href="%(single_market)s">Digital Single Market</a> could produce good or bad new copyright law. <a href="%(change)s">Join us</a> and others in the fight!
Protesti proti zakonom SOPA in PIPA v ZDA ter proti ACTA v Evropi so dosegli, da so bili zakoni, ki bi lahko zatrli odprte inovacije, opuščeni.

;Get creative
Bodite ustvarjalni


;Keep making memes, posting links, and getting creative on the Web with <a href="%(attribution)s">respectful attribution</a>.

;Patents were designed to create incentive for innovation. But the patent system and software development don’t always get along so well. Software patents are often written so broadly that they’re open to misinterpretation, and exclusive rights can far outlive the shelf life of the software itself. All of which creates obstacles and uncertainty for innovators, and leaves the door open for patent trolls and endless litigation.
