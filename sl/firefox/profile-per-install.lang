;An Important Change in Firefox: Dedicated Profiles
Pomembna sprememba v Firefoxu: Namenski profili


;What’s Changed
Kaj se je spremenilo


;Before, all Firefox installations were sharing a single profile by default. Now, Firefox provides dedicated profiles for each Firefox installation (this includes installations of Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, or Firefox ESR). This will make Firefox more stable when switching between Firefox installations on the same computer.
Doslej so vse nameščene različice Firefoxa privzeto uporabljale skupen profil. Sedaj Firefox vsaki nameščeni različici Firefoxa (vključno z izdajami Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta ali Firefox ESR) dodeli lasten profil. S tem bodo preprečene težave, ki lahko nastanejo pri izmenični uporabi več različic Firefoxa na istem računalniku.


;How Dedicated Profiles Work
Kako namenski profili delujejo


;Firefox saves information such as bookmarks, passwords and user preferences in a set of files called your profile. This profile is stored in a separate location from the Firefox program files.
Firefox hrani vaše podatke, kot so zaznamki, gesla in nastavitve, v naboru datotek, imenovanem profil. Profil je shranjen na ločenem mestu od Firefoxovih programskih datotek.


;The installation you choose as your primary Firefox installation will keep your previously shared profile data like bookmarks, history and passwords.
Različica, ki jo boste izbrali kot svojo glavno namestitev Firefoxa, bo obdržala vaše doslej skupne podatke profila, kot so zaznamki, zgodovina in gesla.


;You have not lost any personal data or customizations. Any previous profile data is safe and attached to the first Firefox installation that was opened after this change.

;All of your Firefox installations will now have separate profiles.
Vsaka nameščena različica Firefoxa bo odslej imela svoj profil.


;What You Need to Do
Kaj morate storiti


;If you do nothing, each installation will have a separate profile. This means your profile data will be different on each installation of Firefox.
Če ne storite ničesar, bo vsaka nameščena različica imela svoj profil. To pomeni, da bodo vaši podatki profila v vsaki različici Firefoxa drugačni.


;You can change which installation uses which profile using the profile manager. Directions on how to use the profile manager are available on <a href="%(support)s">this support page</a>.

;While profiles are now connected to each installation of Firefox, you can use your Firefox Account to keep them in sync. If you would like all of your profile data to be the same on all installations of Firefox, we recommend you sync all of your profiles with a Firefox Account.

;A Firefox Account is the easiest way to make your profiles consistent on all of your versions of Firefox. You also get additional benefits like sending tabs and secure password storage.
