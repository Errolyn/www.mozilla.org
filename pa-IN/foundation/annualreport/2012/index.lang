;We are champions of a Web where people know more, do more and do better.
ਅਸੀਂ ਅਜਿਹੇ ਵੈੱਬ ਦੇ ਚੈਂਪੀਅਨ ਹਾਂ ਜਿੱਥੇ ਲੋਕ ਵਧੇਰੇ ਜਾਣਨ, ਵਧੇਰੇ ਕਰਨ ਹਨ ਅਤੇ ਬਿਹਤਰ ਕੰਮ ਕਰਦੇ ਹਨ।

ਸਭ ਲਈ ਇੱਕ ਵੈੱਬ


;As the Web expands to reach billions of new people and touch our lives in new ways, it has become an essential part of our individual growth and collective future. And that Web is what the Mozilla community has pledged to protect and promote: a platform providing opportunity, connectivity and inspiration for all.
