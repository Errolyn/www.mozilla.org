;An Important Change in Firefox: Dedicated Profiles
An Important Change in Firefox: Dedicated Profiles


;What’s Changed
Neler değişti?


;Before, all Firefox installations were sharing a single profile by default. Now, Firefox provides dedicated profiles for each Firefox installation (this includes installations of Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, or Firefox ESR). This will make Firefox more stable when switching between Firefox installations on the same computer.

;How Dedicated Profiles Work
How Dedicated Profiles Work


;Firefox saves information such as bookmarks, passwords and user preferences in a set of files called your profile. This profile is stored in a separate location from the Firefox program files.
Firefox; yer imleriniz, parolalarınız ve kullanıcı tercihleriniz gibi bilgileri “profil” denilen bir dizi dosyada kaydeder. Bu profil, Firefox program dosyalarından ayrı bir yerde saklanır.


;The installation you choose as your primary Firefox installation will keep your previously shared profile data like bookmarks, history and passwords.
Birincil Firefox kurulumunuz olarak seçtiğiniz kurulum, önceden paylaşılan yer imleri, geçmiş ve parolalar gibi profil verilerinizi tutacaktır.


;You have not lost any personal data or customizations. Any previous profile data is safe and attached to the first Firefox installation that was opened after this change.

;While profiles are now connected to each installation of Firefox, you can use your Firefox Account to keep them in sync. If you would like all of your profile data to be the same on all installations of Firefox, we recommend you sync all of your profiles with a Firefox Account.

;A Firefox Account is the easiest way to make your profiles consistent on all of your versions of Firefox. You also get additional benefits like sending tabs and secure password storage.
