;What you do online is your business, and you can keep it that way. Get smart on tracking.
Оно што радите на интернету је ваша приватна ствар и држите се тога. Праћење.


;Ask yourself
Запитајте се


;Do you feel in control of your personal information online?
Да ли имате контролу над вашим личним подацима на интернету?


;Do you know what a cookie is (no, not the delicious kind)?
Да ли знате шта су колачићи (не бакини колачићи)?


;Have you ever wondered why some content, like ads, seems to follow you around?
Да ли сте се икада запитали зашто неки садржаји, на пример рекламе, изгледају као да вас прате?


;What is tracking?
Шта је праћење?


;Every time we go online, we leave behind traces of our activity. They’re often called our “digital footprints” and for good reason, because tracking is sort of like re-tracing our steps.
Сваки пут када одемо на интернет, остављамо мало трагове о нашој активности. Они се често називају "дигитални отисци" и то са добрим разлогом, јер је праћење нешто као проналажење наших корака.


;But our digital footprints reveal more about us than where we’ve been — everything from our preferences to our identities.
Али наши дигитални отисци откривају више о нама него о томе где смо били — све од наших подешавања то наших идентитета.

;Tracking in action
Функционисање праћења


;Let’s imagine a typical day online: you start by checking emails, maybe share a fun article you just read.
Замислимо типичан дан на интернету: започнете проверавањем е-поште, можда поделите занимљив чланак који сте управо прочитали.


;At lunch, you check showtimes for a movie a friend recommended on Facebook and look up prices for some new camping gear you’ve had your eye on.
На ручку проверите време приказивања филма који вам је пријатељ препоручио на Facebook-у и погледате цене нове опреме за камповање.


;That’s only a few sites, but what’s happening behind the scenes is that many more “third-parties” — companies that are separate from the sites you’re visiting — are seeing and recording your activity.
То је само неколико сајтова, али оно што се дешава иза свега тога је да много “трећих лица” — компаније које су одвојене од сајтова које посећујете — гледају и снимају ваше активности.


;So when you begin seeing recommended articles about that movie, or ads for that camping gear, later in the day, it’s no coincidence.
Тако да када видите препоручени чланак о том филму или рекламу за ту опрему за камповање у току дана, то није случајност.


;Tracking for personalization
Праћење за персонализацију


;What are cookies?
Шта су колачићи?


;Cookies are small data files that websites and third parties place on your computer to remember your preferences or to track your activity, sometimes across multiple sites.
Колачићи су мале датотеке података које сајтови и "трећа лица" чувају на вашем рачунару да би запамтили ваша подешавања или да би пратили ваше активности, понекад преко више сајтова.


# This fragment follows the number '76%'. If this doesn't work for your locale, you can start the sentence with "Percentage of adults who…"
;of adults say they are “not too confident” or “not at all confident” that records of their activity maintained by the online advertisers who place ads on the websites they visit will remain private and secure.
одраслих каже да “нису превише” или “уопште” уверени да ће евиденција њихових активности одржавана од стране интернет оглашивача који стављају рекламе на сајтове које они посећују, остати приватна и сигурна.

;The websites we visit will often collect data about us to better personalize our experiences with them.
Веб сајтови које посећујемо често сакупљају податке о нама да би боље персонализовали наша искуства са њима.


;The information they gather through analytics can be used to make navigating their site easier for us or to present us more relevant offers.
Инфромације које сакупљају кроз анализе, могу бити искоришћене лакше коришћење њиховог сајта или да нам представе више одговарајућих понуда.


;They also use cookies — small data files placed in our browsers — to remember language preferences or the contents in a shopping cart.
Такође користе колачиће — мале датотеке података смештене у нашем прегледачу — да запамте подешавања језика или садржај у корпи за куповину.
