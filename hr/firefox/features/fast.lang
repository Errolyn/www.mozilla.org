;We’ve been working out, so you can get more done.
Uvježbavali smo se kako biste vi mogli učiniti više.


;Use less memory
Koristite manje memorije


# A hog is something that claims or takes all of everything. Here it references to a program that takes up all the resources and slow down the computer.
# Lean and mean here means having no excess of what's needed and is single focused. Mean also is defined as nasty, thus the reference of "we're pretty nice". Be transcreative if needed.
;No one likes a computer hog! Firefox is a lean, mean (actually we’re pretty nice) browsing machine. Since we use less RAM than Chrome, your other programs can keep running at top speed.
Nitko ne voli programe koji misle da je računalo u potpunosti njihovo! Firefox je brz i jednostavan preglednik. Budući da koristi manje RAM nego Chrome, drugi programi će moći istovremeno raditi s punim brzinama.


;Get all the tabs without lags
Otvorite sve kartice bez usporavanja


;Multi-tasking with multiple tabs just got easier. Firefox is now a multi-process browser, which means that your tabs stay fresh and won’t take forever to reload. With 86% less hang time, switch quickly between tabs even as you open more.
Multitasking s više kartica je još lakši. Firefox je sada višeprocesni preglednik, što znači da će vaše kartice ostati svježe i neće vam trebati vječnostkako biste ih učitali. S 86% manje vremena za učitavanje, brzo se prebacujte između kartica.
