;A Healthy Internet is Inclusive to All
Uma internet saudável é inclusiva para todos


;The more voices, perspective, languages, and people contributing to the Web, the richer the experience for everyone. But the whole Internet is not yet accessible, welcoming, and safe for all. Together, we have the power to shape the Web, and our world along with it.
Quanto mais vozes, perspectivas, linguagens e pessoas contribuindo para a Web, mais rica a experiência para todos. Mas toda a Internet ainda não é acessível, acolhedora e segura para todos. Juntos, temos o poder de moldar a Web e, com ela, o nosso mundo.


;A healthy Internet is open to you.

;Digital Inclusion means promoting diversity
Inclusão digital significa promover a diversidade


;For the Internet to fulfill its greatest promise, it must reflect the diversity and experience of all people, everywhere.
Para que a Internet possa cumprir a sua maior promessa, ela deve refletir a diversidade e a experiência de todas as pessoas, em todos os lugares.


;As inclusive as the Web can seem, it’s not yet an equal playing field. More than half the world is still without it; emerging economies and marginalized communities are often the last to gain access. Far fewer women are using the Internet than men. And without diversity among its creators, the Web itself will reflect unconscious biases, while personalizing algorithms can reinforce our own.
Apesar da Web parecer abrangente, ainda não é igualitária. Mais de metade do mundo ainda está sem ela; As economias emergentes e as comunidades periféricas são muitas vezes as últimas a ter acesso. Menos mulheres estão usando a Internet que os homens. E sem diversidade entre os seus criadores, a própria Web irá refletir preconceitos inconscientes, enquanto algoritmos de personalização podem reforçar.


;In nine developing countries, women are still nearly 50% less likely to access the Internet than men.
Nove países em desenvolvimento e as mulheres tem quase 50% menos probabilidade de acesso à Internet do que os homens.

;We’ve all seen our share of nasty comments sections. At times, the Web can feel like a very unfriendly place – particularly for women, minorities, and members of marginalized communities. By discouraging people from getting online, cyberbullying and cyber violence threaten not just individuals, but the Internet itself.

;To participate online, you have to be able to get online. Programs have emerged that offer free or subsidized Internet access, but it is often slow or restricted, creating a ‘poor Internet for poor people.’ At its most extreme, governments worldwide are turning off all or parts of the Internet to serve their own agendas, which can threaten human rights and even the health of the global economy.
