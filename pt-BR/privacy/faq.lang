# "Under the hood" is an expression in automobile industry. Here it is a metaphor about something that exists but out of sight, behind the scenes.
;It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details. That is still true for Firefox, where we find that people have many different ideas of what is happening under the hood in their browser.
Pode ser complicado para as pessoas entenderem o que esperar de qualquer software ou serviços que usam atualmente. A tecnologia que mantém nossas vidas é complexa e nem todos têm tempo para conhecê-la profundamente. Isto ainda é verdade em se tratando do Firefox, onde vemos que as pessoas têm noções diferentes sobre o que está por trás dos bastidores do seu navegador.

;We follow a set of <a href="%(link)s">Data Privacy Principles</a> that shape our approach to privacy in the Firefox desktop and mobile browsers.
Seguimos uma série de <a href="%(link)s">princípios de privacidade de dados</a> que moldam nossa abordagem quanto a privacidade nos navegadores de computadores e dispositivos móveis.


;We only collect the data we need to make the best products.
Coletamos somente os dados necessários para criar os melhores produtos.


;We put people in control of their data and online experiences.
Colocamos você no controle dos seus dados e experiências on-line.


;We adhere to “no surprises” principle, meaning we work hard to ensure people’s understanding of Firefox matches reality.
Aderimos ao princípio de “sem surpresas”, isto é, trabalhamos duro para assegurar que o entendimento que as pessoas têm sobre o Firefox esteja alinhado com a realidade.


;The following questions and answers should help you understand what to expect from Mozilla and Firefox:
As seguintes perguntas e respostas devem ajudá-lo a entender o que esperar da Mozilla e do Firefox:


;I use Firefox for almost everything on the Web. You folks at Mozilla must know a ton of stuff about me, right?
Uso o Firefox para quase tudo na web. Vocês da Mozilla devem ter uma tonelada de informações sobre mim, não é?


;Firefox, the web browser that runs on your device or computer, is your gateway to the internet. Your browser will manage a lot of information about the websites you visit, but that information stays on your device. Mozilla, the company that makes Firefox, doesn’t collect it (unless you ask us to).
O Firefox, navegador executado no seu dispositivo ou computador, é a sua porta de acesso à Internet. Seu navegador gerenciará muitas informações sobre os sites que você visita, no entanto, tais informações permanecem no seu dispositivo. A Mozilla, empresa que faz o Firefox, não as coleta ─ a menos que você nos peça.


;Really, you don’t collect my browsing history?
Sério? Meu histórico de navegação não é coletado?

;Mozilla doesn’t know as much as you’d expect about how people browse the web. As a browser maker, that’s actually a big challenge for us. That is why we’ve built opt-in tools, such as <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, which allows interested users to give us insight into their web browsing. If you sync your browsing history across Firefox installations, we don’t know what that history is - because it’s encrypted by your device.
A Mozilla não conhece tanto quando você poderia esperar sobre como as pessoas navegam pela Internet. Este é um grande desafio para nós como criador de navegador. É por isso que criamos ferramentas opcionais como o <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, que permite que usuários interessados nos concedam conhecimento de sua navegação na Internet. Não temos conhecimento do seu histórico quando você o sincroniza entre plataformas do Firefox, uma vez que são criptografados pelo seu dispositivo.


;It seems like every company on the web is buying and selling my data. You’re probably no different.
Parece que toda empresa na Web está comprando e vendendo meus dados, vocês não são diferentes.


;Mozilla doesn’t sell data about you, and we don’t buy data about you.
A Mozilla não vende e nem comprar dados sobre você.


;Wait, so how do you make money?
Então, como vocês lucram?

;The second is what we call "interaction data." This is data about an individual's engagement with Firefox, such as the number of tabs that were open, the status of user preferences, or number of times certain browser features were used, such as screenshots or containers. For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed.

;We may also collect additional data in pre-release for one of our <a href="%(link)s">studies</a>. For example, some studies require what we call “web activity data” data, which may include URLs and other information about certain websites. This helps us answer specific questions to improve Firefox, for example, how to better integrate popular websites in specific locales.

;Mozilla’s pre-release versions of Firefox are development platforms, frequently updated with experimental features. We collect more data in pre-release than what we do after release in order to understand how these experimental features are working. You can opt out of having this data collected in preferences.
