;Firefox is now faster and leaner

# Working out means exercising to get lighter and more proficent.  Here it means Firefox is lighter thus the speed faster.
;We’ve been working out, so you can get more done.
Titekitinij uan ijkón tionuelis okachi taman kichiuas.


;Use less memory
Kikui amo okachi taelnamikilis


# A hog is something that claims or takes all of everything. Here it references to a program that takes up all the resources and slow down the computer.
# Lean and mean here means having no excess of what's needed and is single focused. Mean also is defined as nasty, thus the reference of "we're pretty nice". Be transcreative if needed.
;No one likes a computer hog! Firefox is a lean, mean (actually we’re pretty nice) browsing machine. Since we use less RAM than Chrome, your other programs can keep running at top speed.
