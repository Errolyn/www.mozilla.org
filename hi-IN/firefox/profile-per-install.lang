;An Important Change in Firefox: Dedicated Profiles
Firefox में एक महत्वपूर्ण बदलाव: विशिष्ट प्रोफाइलें


;What’s Changed
क्या बदला है


;Before, all Firefox installations were sharing a single profile by default. Now, Firefox provides dedicated profiles for each Firefox installation (this includes installations of Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, or Firefox ESR). This will make Firefox more stable when switching between Firefox installations on the same computer.
पहले, सभी Firefox इंस्टालेशन एक ही प्रोफाइल डिफ़ॉल्ट रूप से साझा करते थे। अब, Firefox प्रत्येक Firefox इंस्टालेशन के लिए विशिष्ट प्रोफाइल प्रदान करता है (इसमें Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, अथवा Firefox ESR के इंस्टालेशन शामिल हैं)। एक ही कंप्यूटर पर अन्य Firefox के बीच अदला बदली करते समय यह Firefox को और भी संतुलित बनयेगा।


;How Dedicated Profiles Work
विशिष्ट प्रोफाइलें कैसे काम करतीं हैं


;Firefox saves information such as bookmarks, passwords and user preferences in a set of files called your profile. This profile is stored in a separate location from the Firefox program files.

;While profiles are now connected to each installation of Firefox, you can use your Firefox Account to keep them in sync. If you would like all of your profile data to be the same on all installations of Firefox, we recommend you sync all of your profiles with a Firefox Account.

;A Firefox Account is the easiest way to make your profiles consistent on all of your versions of Firefox. You also get additional benefits like sending tabs and secure password storage.
