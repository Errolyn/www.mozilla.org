;Comparing Firefox Browser with Apple Safari
Firefox Browser fergelykje mei Apple Safari


;If you use a Mac or have an iPhone, chances are you’re familiar with the Safari web browser. The fact that it’s pre-installed as the default browser for Apple product users definitely gives it an early advantage, but Firefox has its own set of useful features that make it an attractive alternative. Here we’ll explore the main differences between our browser and Safari in terms of privacy, utility, and portability between devices.
As jo in Mac brûke of in iPhone hawwe, is de kâns grut dat jo bekend binne mei de Safari-webbrowser. It feit dat it yn it foar ynstallearre is as de standertbrowser foar brûkers fan Apple-produkten, jout it seker in betiid foardiel, mar Firefox hat syn eigen set handige funksjes dy't it in oantreklik alternatyf meitsje. Hjir sille wy de wichtichste ferskillen tusken ús browser en Safari op it mêd fan privacy, brûkberheid en portabiliteit tusken apparaten ferkenne.


;Privacy has become a white hot topic for tech companies as they realize more and more people are feeling vulnerable to things like data breaches, ad trackers and hackers. But when it comes down to the real tools people use to navigate the actual interwebs, is it all talk or are they actually taking action to keep your data secure?
Privacy is in faaks besprutsen ûnderwerp foar technologybedriuwen wurden, omdat se harren realisearje dat hieltyd mear minsken harren kwetsber fiele foar saken as datalekken, advertinsjetrackers en hackers. Mar as it giet om de echte middelen dy't minsken brûke om troch de eigentlike ynterwebs te navigearjen, bliuwt it dan by wurden of ûndernimme se echt aksje om jo gegevens feilich te hâlden?


;As alluded to before, Apple is one of those companies that recently decided to step up their privacy game. Not long ago, Apple implemented cross-site tracking prevention in Safari, which prevents ads from following you around the internet. Safari also offers a strong password suggestion when you sign up for a new account on any website. And if you’re invested in the iCloud ecosystem, it syncs that password securely with your other devices, so you never actually have to remember it.
Lykas earder fermeld, is Apple ien fan dy bedriuwen dy't koartlyn besluten hat mear oandacht oan privacy te jaan. Noch net sa lang lyn hat Apple cross-site-trackingprevinsje ymplemintearre yn Safari, wêrtroch foarkommen wurdt dat advertinsjes jo folgje op ynternet. Safari biedt ek in sterk-wachtwurdsuggesje wannear't jo jo oanmelde foar in nij account op elke website. En as jo gebrûk meitsje fan it iCloud-ekosysteem, syngronisearret it dat wachtwurd feilich mei jo oare apparaten, sadat jo it eins nea hoege te ûnthâlden.


# "Standing on the soap box" means trying to spread a persuasive message to the masses. Alternative: "We've been spreading the message about privacy for a long time." Soap used to come in wooden crates, and this idiom refers to activists or preachers who would stand on an empty soap box on a street corner to speak to a crowd.
;Like Safari, we at Firefox have made a point of focusing on privacy and security. But unlike Safari, we’ve been standing on the privacy soap box for a long time. In fact, Mozilla (our parent company) was one of the first voices in the tech community to sound the alarm for online privacy.
Krekt as Safari hawwe wy by Firefox privacy en feilichheid in haadtema makke. Mar yn tsjinstelling ta Safari dogge wy dat al hiel lang. Mozilla (ús memmebedriuw) wie self ien fan de earste stimmen yn de technyske mienskip dy't alarm sloech oer online privacy.


;Our Private Browsing mode blocks trackers and erases your passwords, cookies and history every time you close it. But you can also experience our advanced privacy features even in regular browsing mode. With the latest edition of Firefox, enhanced tracking prevention is turned on by default. This prevents things like cross-site trackers from following you as you jump around the web. Also, with Facebook being caught out almost daily for privacy problems, our <a %(attrs)s>Facebook Container</a> extension makes a lot of sense. It makes it harder for Facebook to track you around the web — similar to what Safari does to prevent cross-site tracking — but Firefox actually isolates your Facebook session into a separate container blocking Facebook from tracking what you do on other websites. Why do they need to know what you look up on WebMD anyway?
Us priveenavigaasjemodus blokkearret trackers en wisket jo wachtwurden, cookies en skiednis hieltyd wannear't jo dizze slute. Mar jo kinne ek ús avansearre privacyfunksjes ûnderfine, sels yn de normale navigaasjemodus. Mei de nijste ferzje fan Firefox is Ferbettere beskerming tsjin folgjen standert ynskeakele. Dit foarkomt dat saken as cross-site-trackers jo folgje wylst jo oer it web surfe. Omdat Facebook hast deistich betrape wurdt op privacyproblemen, is ús útwreiding <a %(attrs)s>Facebook Container</a> bot logysk. It makket it swierder foar Facebook om jo op ynternet te folgjen – fergelykber mei wat Safari docht om cross-site-tracking foar te kommen – mar Firefox isolearret jo Facebook-sesje yn in aparte kontener, wêrtroch Facebook net folgje kin wat jo op oare websites dogge. Wêrom moatte se ommers witte wat jo opsykje op WebMD?


;As far as security goes, Firefox is solid there as well. Any time you’re in Firefox, you can right-click in the password field to securely generate a strong password using the Fill Password option. When you save your new password, we will prompt you to save to its built-in password manager, <a %(lockwise)s>Lockwise</a>. We also serve up users and account holders with another free and useful product called <a %(monitor)s>Monitor</a> that automatically alerts you if your data is included in a known data breach.
Wat befeiliging oanbelanget is Firefox ek solide. Hieltyd wannear't jo Firefox brûke, kinne jo mei de rjochtermûsknop yn it wachtwurdfjild klikke om feilich in sterk wachtwurd te generearjen mei de opsje Wachtwurd ynfolje. Wannear't jo jo nije wachtwurd bewarje, sille wy jo freegje om dit te bewarjen yn de ynboude wachtwurdbehearder, <a %(lockwise)s>Lockwise</a>. Wy biede brûkers mei en sûnder in account ek in oar fergees en nuttich produkt mei de namme <a %(monitor)s>Monitor</a>, dat jo automatysk warskôget as jo gegevens foarkomme yn in bekend datalek.


;If you choose to use Safari, you’re in safe hands as long as you’re using an Apple device. But Safari only works on Apple devices, whereas Firefox works on Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and Linux. So no matter what operating system you choose, Firefox has you covered with our security and privacy protections.
As jo derfoar kieze om Safari te brûken, binne jo yn feilige hannen salang as jo in Apple-apparaat brûke. Mar Safari wurket allinnich op Apple-apparaten, wylst Firefox op Windows, Mac, iOS, Android en Linux wurket. It makket dus net út hokker bestjoeringssysteem jo kieze, mei Firefox hawwe jo oeral ús befeiliging en privacybeskerming.


;Apple is widely known for its closed ecosystem as it relates to creating software for its products. But inside the App Store, it does offer a section to developers to create plugins and add-ons to make the browser more robust. These extensions are also browsable through the App Store and easily added to Safari.
Apple stiet bekend om syn sluten ekosysteem, omdat it betrekking hat op it meitsjen fan software foar syn produkten. Mar yn de App Store biedt it wol in seksje foar ûntwikkelers om ynstekkers en add-ons te meitsjen om de browser robúster te meitsjen. Dizze útwreidingen binne ek troch te sykjen fia de App Store en kinne ienfâldich tafoege wurde oan Safari.


;In addition to the regular set of features you’d expect in a browser, such as tabbed browsing and private browsing, Safari has some unexpected features as well. For instance, if a user were to right-click a word anywhere on a page inside Safari, then click Look Up, they’d get a dictionary definition plus entries from the thesaurus, App Store, movies and more. Safari’s Parental Controls are easy to customize, allowing the adults to breathe a little easier when the kids begin to get curious about the internet.

;Like Safari, Firefox encourages its enthusiastic developer community to create <a %(attrs)s>add-ons and extensions</a> to the browser. And since our platform is open-source, there’s a vast selection adding a wealth of functionality.

;Also, when you sign up for a Firefox account you get access to some unique services like Screenshots, <a %(pocket)s>Pocket</a> and <a %(send)s>Send</a> that integrate directly into the browser. Screenshots is a feature built right into the Firefox browser, allowing you to copy or download any or all part of a web page. When you save the screenshot, you can also choose which folder you want to find it in, instead of cluttering your desktop. The Pocket for Firefox button lets you save web pages and videos to Pocket in just one click, so you can read a clean, distraction-free version whenever and wherever you want — even offline. With Send, you can share large files with end-to-end encryption and a variety of security controls, such as the ability to set an expiration time for a file link to expire, the number of downloads, and whether to add an optional password for an extra layer of security.

;Both browsers have a lot of crossover features, as well as some unique functions. It’s worth mentioning, if you take a lot of screenshots, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without this handy feature that’s built right into Firefox. But if you’re just looking for a fast, private browser for surfing and shopping, then you may want to give Firefox a try — especially if you’ve been exclusively using Safari because it came preloaded as the default browser on your computer. Eventually, you’ll discover which one is more suited to your needs.

;Firefox and Safari both provide a seamless experience when moving from desktop to mobile browsing or vice versa. For Safari, one of its main strengths is its continuity features. It syncs your bookmarks, tabs, history and more to iCloud so they’re available on all your devices. That means you can open a tab on your iPhone and have it also appear on your Mac laptop with just a click.

;Firefox also offers a similar sync feature when you sign up for a free <a %(attrs)s>Firefox Account</a> that enables users to easily synchronize their bookmarks, browsing history, preferences, passwords, filled forms, add-ons, and the last 25 opened tabs across multiple computers. What sets Firefox apart from Safari is that it is available on any desktop or mobile platform, iOS, Android, Windows or macOS, boosting its portability across any device you may own.

;The Firefox app for <a %(ios)s>iOS</a> and <a %(android)s>Android</a> is one of the fastest browsers available and also has solid security and anti-tracking features — a huge plus if you’re constantly bouncing between a laptop and mobile devices.

;Since Safari is Apple’s proprietary web browser, its iCloud syncing works exclusively with Apple products. This can be somewhat limiting if, for example, you’re both an Android user and an iPhone user or if you have a Windows based PC for work but use an iPhone as your personal device.

;Safari does a great job of making the browsing experience simple, fast, and seamless if you’re an Apple user with multiple Apple products. Like Safari, Firefox is a fast and utilitarian browser, but privacy and cross-platform compatibility are our defining features. Firefox updates each month with new features and functionality. For example, one recent update switched on our <a %(attrs)s>Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP)</a> by default for new users, which effectively blocks cookies and cross-site trackers.

;In the end, it just boils down to what you value in your browser. If you’re integrated with the Apple ecosystem, Safari is still a great choice. But if you value having the latest and greatest privacy protections and being able to work across multiple operating systems, we think Firefox is your best bet. Firefox is also a solid option as a secondary browser for those Apple-exclusive users who may want to switch into a different browser for those online moments that call for extra layers of privacy protection.
