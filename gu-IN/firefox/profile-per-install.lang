;An Important Change in Firefox: Dedicated Profiles
An Important Change in Firefox: Dedicated Profiles


;What’s Changed
શું બદલાઈ ગયું છે


;Before, all Firefox installations were sharing a single profile by default. Now, Firefox provides dedicated profiles for each Firefox installation (this includes installations of Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, or Firefox ESR). This will make Firefox more stable when switching between Firefox installations on the same computer.
