;The Internet is an integral part of modern life—a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole.
ઇન્ટરનેટ આધુનિક જીવનનો અભિન્ન ભાગ છે—શિક્ષણ, સંદેશાવ્યવહાર, સહકાર, વેપાર, મનોરંજન અને સમગ્ર સમાજમાં એક મુખ્ય ઘટક.

પરિચય


;The Internet is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives.
ઇન્ટરનેટ આપણા જીવનનો અગત્યનો ભાગ બની રહ્યો છે.


;The Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet. We have worked together since 1998 to ensure that the Internet is developed in a way that benefits everyone. We are best known for creating the Mozilla Firefox web browser.

;The Mozilla project uses a community-based approach to create world-class open source software and to develop new types of collaborative activities. We create communities of people involved in making the Internet experience better for all of us.

;There are many different ways of advancing the principles of the Mozilla Manifesto. We welcome a broad range of activities, and anticipate the same creativity that Mozilla participants have shown in other areas of the project. For individuals not deeply involved in the Mozilla project, one basic and very effective way to support the Manifesto is to use Mozilla Firefox and other products that embody the principles of the Manifesto.
