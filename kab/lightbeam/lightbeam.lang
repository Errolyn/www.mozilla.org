;Lightbeam for Firefox
Lightbeam i Firefox


;Lightbeam is a Firefox add-on that uses interactive visualizations to show you the first and third party sites you interact with on the Web.
Lightbeam d asiɣzef n Firefox yessawalen i uskan amyigawan akken ad twaliḍ anwa ismal wis kraḍ ukud tettmeslayeḍ war ma teẓriḍ.


;Shine a Light on Who’s Watching You

;See who’s tracking you online

;As you browse, Lightbeam reveals the full depth of the Web today, including parts that are not transparent to the average user.
Skud tettiniged, Lightbeam ak-d-yemmal tabaḍnit n Web n wass-a, ula d ayen yeffren ɣer umdan n menwala.

;Lightbeam will create a record of events for every site you visit and every third party site that is stored locally on your browser.
Lightbeam ad yernu aɣmis n tedyanin n yal asmel wiɣer terziḍ akked ismal akk wis kraḍ anida adsil yettwasekles ɣef iminig inek.


;Lightbeam visually graphs these events to highlight the interactions between sites you intentionally visit and the third parties.
Lightbeam ad d-yesken di tmeẓri tudlift tidyanin agi akken ad d-ban temyigawt gar yesmal wiɣer terziḍ akked wis krad.


;Lightbeam will continue to add to your graph as you browse the Web. You can stop Lightbeam at any time by disabling it or uninstalling the add-on. Your Lightbeam data can be easily saved or deleted.

;Tracking & privacy
Asfuɣel & tbaḍnit


;Not all tracking is bad. Many services rely on user data to provide relevant content and enhance your online experience.

;But tracking can happen without the user’s knowledge.

;That’s not okay for some.
Kra n yemdanen ur qebblen ara ayagi.


;It should be you who decides when, how and if you want your browsing data to be shared. We recognize the importance of transparency and our mission is all about empowering users — both with tools and information.

;Visualize your data

;After you download and install the Lightbeam add-on to Firefox, it will begin to create a real time visualization of the websites you visit and all the third parties that are also active on those pages.

;Analyze your connections

;As your visualizations grow, you can take a closer look into the relationships between the various first and third party sites that are stored in your data. You can also reset or save your data at any time.
