;Find your best browser for speed, privacy and security.
寻找对您来说，速度、隐私和安全性表现最佳的浏览器。


# HTML page description
;So many browser options, but there’s only one that works best for your needs. The best browser for you should offer both speed and privacy protection.
浏览器百家争鸣，但只有一款最适合您。最佳的浏览器应该上网超快，又可保护您的隐私。


;Privacy, speed, and security.
隐私、速度与安全。


;How to choose the best browser for you.
如何选择最适合您的浏览器。


;The internet has become as essential as electricity and running water, so choosing the best browser for you is more important than ever. The internet is a second office, a teacher and sometimes a medical advisor, even if your actual doctor would prefer you didn’t look up your symptoms online.
互联网已经变得像电力和自来水一样重要，因此选择最佳的浏览器也比以往任何时候都更重要。互联网就像是第二办公室、一位老师，甚至是医疗顾问，纵然您的医生希望您不要在网上查找你的症状。


;In the mid-nineties, Netscape, Internet Explorer and AOL dominated the landscape. It was a simpler time when the sweet melody of dial-up internet rang across the land. You learned the meaning of patience waiting for web pages to load. Back then, all that mattered was browser speed.
上世纪九十年代中期，Netscape、Internet Explorer 与 AOL 占据了市场的主导地位。那是个至纯的时代，拨号上网的美妙旋律响彻整个陆地。你学会了保持耐心，等待网页加载。当时，最重要的是浏览器的速度。


;Today is a different story. Ads, privacy hacks, security breaches, and fake news might have you looking at other qualities in a browser. How does the browser protect your privacy? Does it allow trackers to follow you across the web? Does it built to multitask and handle many computer and internet operations at once?
现今，不可同日而语。您上网时可能会遇到许多广告、隐私黑客、安全漏洞、假新闻。浏览器如何保护您的隐私？会不会允许跟踪器在网络上跟踪您？是否可以多任务，同时处理许多计算机和互联网操作？


;When you use a browser for everything, it needs to be fast. But for the same reason, it needs to be private. A browser has access to everything you do online, so it can put you at real risk if it doesn’t have strong privacy features.
当您用浏览器来做各种事情时，它需要足够快。但也出于同样的原因，确保隐私很必要。浏览器可以访问您在线执行做的所有操作，如果隐私保护功能不够强大，可能会让您面临真正的危险。

;If you’re wondering what it means to have a private or fast browser, here’s a breakdown of three things a browser should have.
如果您想知道浏览器兼顾速度与隐私保护意味着什么，这里有三点可供了解。


;A browser built for speed.
为速度而构建的浏览器。


;A browser is still a tool, so it makes sense that you’ll want to pick the best one for the job. If you’re a human who needs to work to survive, you’ll need a fast internet browser. One thing to keep in mind is a browser that runs third-party trackers is more likely to be slower than a browser that doesn’t. Third-party trackers are cookies, and while you can’t see them, they are running in the background of the site, taking up precious time. The more third-party trackers a browser blocks, the faster it can run.

;This is one of the many reasons to choose the Firefox browser: Firefox blocks third-party trackers by default. We have other reasons and we’ll get into those later.

;A browser that puts safety first.
安全第一的浏览器。


;Remember the last massive data breach? If not, it’s probably because it happens so often. Companies hold on to customer data, like their personal or financial information, and hackers steal it. If you’re making safety a priority, then a secure internet browser is the best browser for you.

;There are a few ways a browser can help its users stay secure. A browser that is up to date with the latest security tech can help protect your computer and websites from unwanted visitors, such as malware or computer viruses.

;The second is not storing too much user data. Hackers can’t steal what’s not there, which is why Firefox keeps a minimum amount of information about its users. <a href="%(data)s">Firefox knows</a> if you use the browser and your general location <a href="%(privacy)s">but not the name of your childhood pet or your favorite color.</a>

;Last but not least, a safe browser should offer tools to help you keep an eye on your accounts. Think of alerts that go straight to your email if any of your accounts get breached or icons that tell you whether a website is encrypted, (i.e., if it’s a good idea to enter your credit number on a shopping site).

;Firefox is offering something new to keep you safe: <a href="%(monitor)s">Firefox Monitor</a>. It’s a free service that will alert you if there are any public hacks on your accounts and let you know if your accounts got hacked in the past. Another neat feature is the Green Lock. It looks like a small green icon at the top left side of the browser window. If you’re on Firefox and see the green lock, it means the website is encrypted and secure. If the lock is grey, you might want to think twice about entering any sensitive information.

;We visit hundreds or even thousands of websites each day, and you can’t expect users to make security and privacy decisions for each of these sites. That is why a browser that gives you more control is so important - because it offers real, meaningful protection.

;Privacy on the web is a hot button issue. If privacy is number one on your list of priorities, you want to look for a browser that takes that seriously. When choosing the best private browser for you, look at the tracking policy and how a browser handles your data. These seem like technical questions, but they’re the reason some browsers are more private than others.

;Trackers are all those annoying “cookies” messages you get on airline sites. These third-party trackers know where you click and can be used to analyze your behavior. A private browser should give users the option to turn off third-party trackers, but ideally, turn them off by default.

;Another way to stop trackers from tracking is using private mode to browse. Any browser that claims to be private should offer browsing in private mode.

;One easy way to check is to visit a browser’s content setting page and privacy policy. The privacy webpage should outline if your data is shared and why. It’s why the <a href="%(privacy)s">Firefox privacy notice</a> is easy to read and easy to find.
