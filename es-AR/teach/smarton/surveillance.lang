;Government surveillance explained
Una explicación sobre la vigilancia del gobierno


;Stakeouts have always been an essential tool for law enforcement and national security.
La vigilancia siempre ha sido una herramienta esencial para forzar el cumplimiento de la ley y la seguridad nacional.


;The difference now is that they’ve moved beyond binoculars, bugs and bad guys: surveillance has gone digital.
La diferencia es que ahora se han movido más allá de los binoculares, micrófonos y personas malas: la vigilancia se convirtió en digital.


;All that data we generate through our daily activities online allows governments to keep an eye on lots of people at once, in hopes of catching the ones who are up to no good.
Toda la información que generamos en nuestras actividades diarias en la red permite a los gobiernos mantener la vigilancia en muchas personas a la vez, con la esperanza de encontrar a quienes quieren generar daño.

;When surveillance is too broad or lacks key safeguards – like getting a warrant from a judge – it can be abused, either accidentally or on purpose. And our personal privacy is what’s at stake.

In order to protect our personal liberties and maintain our trust in the Internet, Mozilla’s policy team proposes that government surveillance must follow three fundamental principles:


;Minimal impact
Impacto mínimo


;Efforts should be made to collect only the information that’s needed, without compromising Internet infrastructure, technology companies’ data systems, or users’ trust.
Efforts should be made to collect only the information that’s needed, without compromising Internet infrastructure, technology companies’ data systems, or users’ trust.


;Accountability
Rendición de cuentas


;Governments should be held accountable.
Los gobiernos deben rendir cuentas de sus actos.


;This means being transparent and specific about information collection, and answering to independent oversight and to the public.
Esto significa mantener una postura transparente y concreta acerca de la recolección de información, que dé respuesta tanto a mecanismos de supervisión privados como públicos.


;User security
Seguridad del usuario


;Strong encryption and security keep us safe from many kinds of criminals.

;Governments shouldn’t weaken the security of all in the name of spying on a few.
Los gobiernos no deberían debilitar la seguridad de todos con la finalidad de espiar solo a unos cuantos.


# Quote in the sidebar
;“Some amount of surveillance for law enforcement and intelligence, properly designed, is valuable to keep us safe. But when it’s too broad, it violates the privacy rights of millions of innocent people, and can even undermine our security.”
“Un cierto grado de vigilancia para reforzar el cumplimiento de la ley y los servicios de inteligencia, concebido adecuadamente, tiene valor para mantenernos seguros. Pero cuando esta es demasiado amplia, viola los derechos de privacidad de millones de personas inocentes, y puede llegar incluso a socavar nuestra propia seguridad”.
