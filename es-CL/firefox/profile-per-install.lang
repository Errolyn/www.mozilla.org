;An Important Change in Firefox: Dedicated Profiles
Un cambio importante en Firefox: Perfiles dedicados


;What’s Changed
Qué ha cambiado


;Before, all Firefox installations were sharing a single profile by default. Now, Firefox provides dedicated profiles for each Firefox installation (this includes installations of Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, or Firefox ESR). This will make Firefox more stable when switching between Firefox installations on the same computer.

;While profiles are now connected to each installation of Firefox, you can use your Firefox Account to keep them in sync. If you would like all of your profile data to be the same on all installations of Firefox, we recommend you sync all of your profiles with a Firefox Account.
