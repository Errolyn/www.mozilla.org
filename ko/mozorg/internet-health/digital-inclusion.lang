;Digital Inclusion: Vital to Internet Health
디지털 포용성: 건강한 인터넷에 필수


;Digital inclusion means promoting diversity, practicing respect, and supporting universal access online.
디지털 포용성이란 다양성을 증진하고 존중을 실천하며 온라인 접근권의 보편화를 지지하는 것을 의미합니다.


;A Healthy Internet is Inclusive to All
건강한 인터넷은 모두를 포용합니다


;The more voices, perspective, languages, and people contributing to the Web, the richer the experience for everyone. But the whole Internet is not yet accessible, welcoming, and safe for all. Together, we have the power to shape the Web, and our world along with it.
더 많은 목소리, 관점, 언어, 사람들이 웹에 기여할수록 모두의 웹 경험도 풍부해집니다. 그러나 아직도 인터넷 전체가 모두에게 안전하고 접근 가능한 공간은 아닙니다. 함께한다면, 우리에게는 웹 환경은 물론, 세상을 바꿀 수 있는 힘이 있습니다.


;A healthy Internet is open to you.
건강한 인터넷은 바로 여러분에게 열려있습니다.


;Here are three areas where we can make a difference.

;As inclusive as the Web can seem, it’s not yet an equal playing field. More than half the world is still without it; emerging economies and marginalized communities are often the last to gain access. Far fewer women are using the Internet than men. And without diversity among its creators, the Web itself will reflect unconscious biases, while personalizing algorithms can reinforce our own.

;We’ve all seen our share of nasty comments sections. At times, the Web can feel like a very unfriendly place – particularly for women, minorities, and members of marginalized communities. By discouraging people from getting online, cyberbullying and cyber violence threaten not just individuals, but the Internet itself.

;To participate online, you have to be able to get online. Programs have emerged that offer free or subsidized Internet access, but it is often slow or restricted, creating a ‘poor Internet for poor people.’ At its most extreme, governments worldwide are turning off all or parts of the Internet to serve their own agendas, which can threaten human rights and even the health of the global economy.
