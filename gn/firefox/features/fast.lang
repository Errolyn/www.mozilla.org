;Get more done. Browse faster and lighter with multiple tabs
Eipuruporã nde aravo. Eikundaha pya’e ha vevuive heta tendayke ndive


# Used as HTML description of the page
;Our new, powerful multi-process platform handles all your tabs without slowing down your computer.

;Firefox is now faster and leaner
Ko’ág̃a Firefox ipya’eve


# Working out means exercising to get lighter and more proficent.  Here it means Firefox is lighter thus the speed faster.
;We’ve been working out, so you can get more done.
Romba’apo hína eipuru porãve hag̃ua nde aravo.


;Use less memory
Oipuru sa’ive mandu’arenda


# A hog is something that claims or takes all of everything. Here it references to a program that takes up all the resources and slow down the computer.
# Lean and mean here means having no excess of what's needed and is single focused. Mean also is defined as nasty, thus the reference of "we're pretty nice". Be transcreative if needed.
;No one likes a computer hog! Firefox is a lean, mean (actually we’re pretty nice) browsing machine. Since we use less RAM than Chrome, your other programs can keep running at top speed.
¡Avave ndoipotái peteĩ kundaha ikarúva! Firefox ha’e kundaha ojapóva tekotevẽkuete. Oipuru sa’ivégui RAM Chrome-gui, ambue ne rembiaporape ikatu omba'apo gueteri pya’eterei.


;Get all the tabs without lags
Eguereko tendayke pya’e


;Multi-tasking with multiple tabs just got easier. Firefox is now a multi-process browser, which means that your tabs stay fresh and won’t take forever to reload. With 86% less hang time, switch quickly between tabs even as you open more.
Ndahasyive ñamba’apo ojojapa heta tendayke ndive. Firefox ha’e ko’ág̃a kundaha hembiapo hetáva, he’iséva ne tendaykekuéra heko ro’ysã ha ndahi’aremo’ãi henyhẽ hag̃ua. 86% sa’ve eipurúta aravo, emoambue pya’e tendayke pa’ũme térã eikeve ambuépe.


;Level-up browser gameplay
Rombopya’e ñembosarái kundahakuérape


# Native speed refers to operating speed for games written for platforms such as macOS or Windows.
;We led the tech to run 3D games at near-native speeds, and now Firefox is bringing better performance to online gaming. Our powerful browser reduces lags, speeds up ping times and optimizes overall gameplay through faster, leaner browsing.
