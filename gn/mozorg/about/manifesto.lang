;Pledge for a Healthy Internet
Roñeha’ãta romoĩ peteĩ ñanduti hesãiva


;The open, global internet is the most powerful communication and collaboration resource we have ever seen. It embodies some of our deepest hopes for human progress. It enables new opportunities for learning, building a sense of shared humanity, and solving the pressing problems facing people everywhere.
Ñandutiveve juruja ha opavavépe g̃uarã niko tembipuru porãite ñañomomarandu hag̃ua ha avei ñamba'apo hag̃ua oñondive. Upévare ore roipota ha roha'ãrõ yvypóra oñakãrapu'ãve ohóvo.

;Over the last decade we have seen this promise fulfilled in many ways. We have also seen the power of the internet used to magnify divisiveness, incite violence, promote hatred, and intentionally manipulate fact and reality. We have learned that we should more explicitly set out our aspirations for the human experience of the internet. We do so now.
Pe pa aryetápe jahecha oiko jaipotáva heta hendáicha. Avei jaiko moañetehárõ ñanduti jepurupy mba'eguasuete jave ñemboja'o térã ñorairõse, ñembyai jeikovai  jejaposéguinte jejapopy añetegua. Rohechakuaa tekotevẽ ojepuru ñanduti hendapeve. Rojapose ko'ág̃a.


;We are committed to an internet that includes all the peoples of the earth — where a person’s demographic characteristics do not determine their online access, opportunities, or quality of experience.
Roñeha’ãta rojapo peteĩ ñanduti oikepahápe opavavete tapicha arapy pegua, mba’evéichagua ava oñemboyke’ỹhápe ñanduti jeiképe, oĩhápe pa’ũ peteĩchaite opavavépe g̃uarã.


;We are committed to an internet that promotes civil discourse, human dignity, and individual expression.

;We are committed to an internet that elevates critical thinking, reasoned argument, shared knowledge, and verifiable facts.
Roñeha’ãta rojapo peteĩ ñanduti omongu’éva jepy’amongeta, ñe’ẽ poravopyre ha umi oikopyre ojehechakuaáva.


;We are committed to an internet that catalyzes collaboration among diverse communities working together for the common good.

;Show Your Support
Ehechauka ne ñepytyvõ


;An internet with these qualities will not come to life on its own. Individuals and organizations must embed these aspirations into internet technology and into the human experience with the internet. The Mozilla Manifesto and Addendum represent Mozilla’s commitment to advancing these aspirations. We aim to work together with people and organizations everywhere who share these goals to make the internet an even better place for everyone.
