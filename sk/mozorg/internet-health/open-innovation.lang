;Open Innovation: Vital to Internet Health
Otvorené inovácie - životne dôležitá vec pre zdravie internetu


# Used as HTML description of the page
;Open Innovation means innovating collectively through shared ideas and open source code.
Otvorené inovácie znamenajú dosiahnutie spoločného cieľa, zdieľanie nápadov a otvorený zdrojový kód.


;A healthy Internet is open for innovation
Zdravý internet je otvorený inováciám


;The Internet was built on the promise that any one of us might create the next big thing. But in order to keep creating, imagining, and reinventing our future online, the building blocks of the Web must be open to all. And together, we need to make sure the policies and laws that govern those building blocks are fair and functional.

Tu sú tri oblasti, v ktorých môžeme niečo zmeniť.

;Open source software – technology built with code that is open for view, use, and modification – is the engine that powers a huge amount of the Internet, from servers to operating systems to the bots that fetch your search results. It’s the infrastructure that makes the Web a truly public resource: transparent, trustworthy, and collaborative, so that anyone with an idea can contribute. But much like our IRL infrastructure, we have to commit the attention and resources to maintain it.

Patents: Building a system that encourages innovation


;Our patent system should work with and for open innovation, not against it.
Náš patentový systém by mal pracovať pre otvorené inovácie, nie proti nim.


;Patents were designed to create incentive for innovation. But the patent system and software development don’t always get along so well. Software patents are often written so broadly that they’re open to misinterpretation, and exclusive rights can far outlive the shelf life of the software itself. All of which creates obstacles and uncertainty for innovators, and leaves the door open for patent trolls and endless litigation.
