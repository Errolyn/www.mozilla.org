# A hog is something that claims or takes all of everything. Here it references to a program that takes up all the resources and slow down the computer.
# Lean and mean here means having no excess of what's needed and is single focused. Mean also is defined as nasty, thus the reference of "we're pretty nice". Be transcreative if needed.
