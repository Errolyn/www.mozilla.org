;Get smart on tracking
更了解什麼是追蹤


# HTML Meta (description). First part of the string is also available in the landing page file (smarton(index.lang)
;What you do online is your business, and you can keep it that way. Get smart on tracking.
你想在網路上做什麼，與他人無關，更加瞭解什麼是追蹤吧！


;Ask yourself
問問看自己


;Do you feel in control of your personal information online?
您覺得自己控制網路上的個人資料嗎？


;Do you know what a cookie is (no, not the delicious kind)?
您知道什麼是 cookie 嗎（並不是美味的那種）？


;Have you ever wondered why some content, like ads, seems to follow you around?
是否曾經好奇為什麼有些東西像是廣告，好像一直跟著您？


;What is tracking?
何謂追蹤？


;Every time we go online, we leave behind traces of our activity. They’re often called our “digital footprints” and for good reason, because tracking is sort of like re-tracing our steps.
每當我們上網時每個舉動都留下足跡，他們通常被稱為「數位足跡」，因為追蹤就如同走過你走的步伐。


;But our digital footprints reveal more about us than where we’ve been — everything from our preferences to our identities.
但數位足跡呈現不僅是我們造訪過哪裡，還有我們的喜好跟身份。


;Watch the documentary at donottrack-doc.com.
觀看 donottrack-doc.com 的紀錄片。

;Tracking in action
你正在被監控


;Let’s imagine a typical day online: you start by checking emails, maybe share a fun article you just read.
一如既往，開始你的一天連上網路後，先看一下電子郵件，也許分享覺得有趣的文章。


;At lunch, you check showtimes for a movie a friend recommended on Facebook and look up prices for some new camping gear you’ve had your eye on.
一邊吃午餐一邊在網路上找幾個朋友在 Facebook 推薦電影的放映時間，順便看看一直想買露營設備價格。


;That’s only a few sites, but what’s happening behind the scenes is that many more “third-parties” — companies that are separate from the sites you’re visiting — are seeing and recording your activity.
看起來你只是打開幾個網站，但在螢幕後面越來越多第三方公司透過你所拜訪的網站記錄觀看你的活動。


;So when you begin seeing recommended articles about that movie, or ads for that camping gear, later in the day, it’s no coincidence.
稍後網站開始推薦你與電影有關的文章或是露營器材的廣告，這些並不是巧合。


;Tracking for personalization
監控個人資訊


;What are cookies?
何謂 cookies？


;Cookies are small data files that websites and third parties place on your computer to remember your preferences or to track your activity, sometimes across multiple sites.
Cookies 是個網站和第三方公司用來記錄你的偏好或者是追蹤你在網路上活動的檔案，有時甚至橫跨數個網站追蹤你的行動。


# This fragment follows the number '76%'. If this doesn't work for your locale, you can start the sentence with "Percentage of adults who…"
;of adults say they are “not too confident” or “not at all confident” that records of their activity maintained by the online advertisers who place ads on the websites they visit will remain private and secure.
的人，對於被詢問自己足跡被線上廣告商紀錄是隱密且安全的，選擇「不是很有信心」或「完全沒信心」。


# "Pew Research Center" is a proper name and shouldn't be translated. Link to https://www.pewinternet.org/2015/05/20/americans-attitudes-about-privacy-security-and-surveillance/
;(Pew Research Center, May 2015)
（皮尤研究中心，2015 年五月）


;The websites we visit will often collect data about us to better personalize our experiences with them.
蒐集紀錄網站通常聲稱他們是為了提供更好的使用者經驗，


;The information they gather through analytics can be used to make navigating their site easier for us or to present us more relevant offers.
那些他們收集的資訊經過分析可以讓使用者在瀏覽網站時能夠找到更符合他們需求的資訊。


;They also use cookies — small data files placed in our browsers — to remember language preferences or the contents in a shopping cart.
他們也使用 cookie，被放置在瀏覽器內的資料檔，用來記得我們語言偏好或購物車內的清單。


;By the way…
順道一提…


;Mozilla sites are no exception. Like most other Web sites, we also use third party tools to improve user experience.
Mozilla 網站也不例外，如同其他網站，我們也使用第三方網站改善我們的使用者經驗。

;Tracking without permission
未經允許的追蹤


;Many websites we visit contain hidden third parties — such as data brokers, affiliate networks and advertising networks — who use cookies, and other data tracking methods, to collect information about our browsing habits without our consent.
許多我們拜訪的網站都隱藏著第三方程式，例如資料交易商、廣告行銷平台，透過使用 cookie 跟其他資料追蹤的方法蒐集我們瀏覽習慣。


;While tracking can be helpful, there can’t be a healthy trade-off between the value it provides and the data it collects without transparency.
雖然也有因為使用追蹤而方便的地方，但資料提供與情報收集的交易之間並沒有完善的機制。


;Going beyond the Web
在網路之外


;Online tracking is just one part of a larger ecosystem of data collection.
線上追蹤只是資料收集的巨大生態系裡其中的一小部分而已。


;Within this ecosystem, anonymized online data can be merged with personally identifiable information about you (information that you may have volunteered on a form, in an app or that was collected offline) to build a surprisingly detailed profile of you.
在這生態系統內，匿名的線上資料也可以和個人身份資訊（像是你曾寫過的線上表單、現實生活被蒐集的資訊或是應用程式中得到的資料等等）結合在一起。接著我們會很驚訝地發現，肉搜居然也可以鉅細彌遺地列出你個人資訊。


;These profiles have the potential to interfere with your life offline, and can contribute to unfair practices by being improperly used for price discrimination, decreased creditworthiness, more expensive insurance coverage or unfavorable employment or health reports.
這份個人資訊絕對有可能干擾你的現實生活，導致不公平的價格差異、信用減少、更貴的保險費或是對你不良的就業或健康報告被公開等。


;While these instances are not widespread yet, they do illustrate the potential depths of what is happening behind the scenes and outside of our control.
雖然這樣的例子並不多見，但也說明了在我們無法察覺之處，仍有我們無法控制的威脅。


;Be the boss of your personal info
自己的個人情報自己管理


;There are many ways you can take back and maintain control of your online activity.
其實有很多方法可以管理及回收你在線上的隱私資訊。


;Here are some important tips, hand-picked by Mozilla experts.
這裡有一些來自 Mozilla 的專家們嚴選，能保護你隱私的超重要小秘訣。


;Think deeper
多想一點


;A lot goes on behind the scenes of the Internet. The more you know, the better you can decide what your information is worth to you.
許多事件發生在網路看不到的地方。知道得越多，越能判斷什麼樣的資訊對你有用。


;Understand the hidden cost of free
了解免費的隱藏價值


;We all like the appeal of “free” apps and online services but if you’re not paying for them, someone is, and what they’re buying may be the data you leave behind.
