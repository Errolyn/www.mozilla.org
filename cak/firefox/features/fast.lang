;Get more done. Browse faster and lighter with multiple tabs

# Used as HTML description of the page
;Our new, powerful multi-process platform handles all your tabs without slowing down your computer.
Ri k'ak'a' chuqa' nimaläj k'ïy tajinïk nuk'che'el yerusamajij konojel ri taq awi', akuchi' man eqal ta nub'än chi re ri akematz'ib' richin nisamäj.


;Firefox is now faster and leaner
Wakami yalan aninäq chuqa' yalan xax ri Firefox


# Working out means exercising to get lighter and more proficent.  Here it means Firefox is lighter thus the speed faster.
;We’ve been working out, so you can get more done.
Tajin yojsamäj richin chi nitikïr nub'än ch'aqa' chik.


;Use less memory
Tokisäx jub'a' tzatzq'ob'äl


# A hog is something that claims or takes all of everything. Here it references to a program that takes up all the resources and slow down the computer.
# Lean and mean here means having no excess of what's needed and is single focused. Mean also is defined as nasty, thus the reference of "we're pretty nice". Be transcreative if needed.
;No one likes a computer hog! Firefox is a lean, mean (actually we’re pretty nice) browsing machine. Since we use less RAM than Chrome, your other programs can keep running at top speed.
¡Majun niqa chuwäch jun itzel kematz'ib'! Firefox jun rusamajib'al xax okik'amaya'l, itzel (qitzij chi ütz qab'anon). Ruma chi niqokisaj jub'a' RAM tzatzq'ob'äl chuwäch ri Chrome, ri ch'aqa' chik taq kema' yetikïr yesamäj yalan aninäq.


;Get all the tabs without lags
Man timayin kik'uluxik ri taq ruwi'


;Multi-tasking with multiple tabs just got easier. Firefox is now a multi-process browser, which means that your tabs stay fresh and won’t take forever to reload. With 86% less hang time, switch quickly between tabs even as you open more.
Ri k'ïy samaj kik'in k'ïy taq ruwi', wakami man k'ayew ta. Ri Firefox wakami jun rokik'amaya'l ri k'ïy tajinïk, ri nuq'ajuj chi ri taq ruwi' junelïk man yek'atanär ta chuqa' man xkeyoke' ta richin yesamäj.

;Level-up browser gameplay
Rupalb'al retz'anem kanob'äl


# Native speed refers to operating speed for games written for platforms such as macOS or Windows.
;We led the tech to run 3D games at near-native speeds, and now Firefox is bringing better performance to online gaming. Our powerful browser reduces lags, speeds up ping times and optimizes overall gameplay through faster, leaner browsing.
