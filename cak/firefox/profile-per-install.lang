;An Important Change in Firefox: Dedicated Profiles
Jun nïm Jaloj pa Firefox: K'aqöl Ruwäch B'i'aj


;What’s Changed
Achike Xjalatäj


;Before, all Firefox installations were sharing a single profile by default. Now, Firefox provides dedicated profiles for each Firefox installation (this includes installations of Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, or Firefox ESR). This will make Firefox more stable when switching between Firefox installations on the same computer.
Nab'ey, ronojel ri taq ruyakoj Firefox kikomonin xa jun ruwäch b'i'aj achi'el k'o wi. Wakami ri Firefox yeruya' ruwäch taq b'i'aj chi ke jujun ruyakoj Firefox ( re nutz'aqatisaj yakoj richin Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, o Firefox ESR). Re re' xtub'än chi yalan jikïl ri Firefox toq nuk'ëx chi kikojol ruyakoj Firefox pa jun kematz'ib'.


;How Dedicated Profiles Work
Achike rub'eyal yesamäj ri Samajel Ruwäch taq B'i'aj


;Firefox saves information such as bookmarks, passwords and user preferences in a set of files called your profile. This profile is stored in a separate location from the Firefox program files.
Firefox yeruyäk taq etamab'äl achi'el taq yaketal, ewan taq tzij chuqa' taq rajowab'al okisanel pa jun molaj yakb'äl kib'ina'am ruwäch ab'i'. Re ruwäch b'i'aj re' niyak pa jun chik k'ojlib'äl chi kiwäch ri taq ruyakb'al rukema' Firefox.


;The installation you choose as your primary Firefox installation will keep your previously shared profile data like bookmarks, history and passwords.
Ri yakoj nacha' achi'el nïm ayakoj richin Firefox xtuk'waj ri rutzij ruwäch ab'i', akomonin pan ajowab'äl, natab'äl chuqa' ewan tzij.


;You have not lost any personal data or customizations. Any previous profile data is safe and attached to the first Firefox installation that was opened after this change.

;While profiles are now connected to each installation of Firefox, you can use your Firefox Account to keep them in sync. If you would like all of your profile data to be the same on all installations of Firefox, we recommend you sync all of your profiles with a Firefox Account.

;A Firefox Account is the easiest way to make your profiles consistent on all of your versions of Firefox. You also get additional benefits like sending tabs and secure password storage.
