# "Under the hood" is an expression in automobile industry. Here it is a metaphor about something that exists but out of sight, behind the scenes.
;It can be tricky for people to know what to expect of any software or services they use today. The technology that powers our lives is complex and people don’t have the time to dig into the details. That is still true for Firefox, where we find that people have many different ideas of what is happening under the hood in their browser.

;We follow a set of <a href="%(link)s">Data Privacy Principles</a> that shape our approach to privacy in the Firefox desktop and mobile browsers.

;We only collect the data we need to make the best products.

;We put people in control of their data and online experiences.

;We adhere to “no surprises” principle, meaning we work hard to ensure people’s understanding of Firefox matches reality.

;I use Firefox for almost everything on the Web. You folks at Mozilla must know a ton of stuff about me, right?
Ninwokisaj Firefox b'ama pa ronojel ri ninb'än pan Ajk'amaya'l. Pa Mozilla k'o chi ketaman k'ïy chuwij rïn, ¿La ke ri'?


;Firefox, the web browser that runs on your device or computer, is your gateway to the internet. Your browser will manage a lot of information about the websites you visit, but that information stays on your device. Mozilla, the company that makes Firefox, doesn’t collect it (unless you ask us to).
Firefox, ri okik'amaya'l nisamäj pan awoyonib'al o pan akematz'ib', ja atzub'al ri' pan K'amaya'l.

;Really, you don’t collect my browsing history?

;Mozilla doesn’t know as much as you’d expect about how people browse the web. As a browser maker, that’s actually a big challenge for us. That is why we’ve built opt-in tools, such as <a href="%(link)s">Firefox Pioneer</a>, which allows interested users to give us insight into their web browsing. If you sync your browsing history across Firefox installations, we don’t know what that history is - because it’s encrypted by your device.

;Mozilla doesn’t sell data about you, and we don’t buy data about you.

;The second is what we call "interaction data." This is data about an individual's engagement with Firefox, such as the number of tabs that were open, the status of user preferences, or number of times certain browser features were used, such as screenshots or containers. For example, we collect this data in terms of the back button, that arrow in the upper left corner of your browser that lets you navigate back to a previous webpage in a way that shows us someone used the back button, but doesn’t tell what specific webpages are accessed.
